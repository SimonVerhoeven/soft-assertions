== Introduction

Given it's the advent of a new year, I thought let's start with something nice and fun that can make live more enjoyable for everyone.

As developers, we write testcases all the time to help us in our development process, and to help us detect potential regressions in the future.

Now ideally we want our testcases to be as efficient as possible, and ideally to require as few reruns as possible. And this is where Soft Assertions come into play.
